Need a full-fledged calendar for scheduling events on your website? Just download one of these and get started. We have curated a collection of some of the best calendar components available in the market that are worth the investment for your next big project. Whether you want to simply use their default set-up without touching the source code or roll up your sleeves to dive deep and customize everything to your heart’s content, these calendars have something to offer for everyone. 

## Bryntum Calendar

Convenience is the theme. The Bryntum Calendar can be used with vanilla JavaScript or popular JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, giving you considerable flexibility for easy integration into a wide range of projects. The component seamlessly connects with the other Bryntum power widgets, such as the [Data Grid](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/09/useful-javascript-data-grid-libraries/).

{{< rimg href="https://files.smashing.media/articles/event-calendars-web-commercial-options/1-bryntum-calendar.png" src="https://files.smashing.media/articles/event-calendars-web-commercial-options/1-bryntum-calendar.png" width="800" height="450" sizes="100vw" caption="(<a href='https://files.smashing.media/articles/event-calendars-web-commercial-options/1-bryntum-calendar.png'>Large preview</a>)" alt="Bryntum calendar" >}}

The out-of-the-box calendar has a modern and clean design with crisp icons. It renders nicely and executes fast. The user controls have smooth transitions and resize well for different screen sizes. Drag and drop for the events is supported. 

Need more than the five nifty themes the calendar comes with? The customization possibilities, using CSS/Sass, go beyond just the calendar views &mdash; day, week, month, year, and agenda &mdash; and include ways to restyle tooltips and user controls with a lot of liberty and just a few keystrokes. Extensive configurations are at hand to update both the impression and functions of the calendar. 

The Bryntum Calendar features include multi-user assigned tasks and time zone support, making it ideal for global teams to collaborate and plan together. For potent project management, there’s the ingenious [resource view](https://bryntum.com/products/calendar/examples/resourceview/?aw=smashing-calendar-options-2024) to monitor at a glance every member’s agenda and see who is free to be scheduled. 

All configuration options and features are well documented with interactive and customizable [live examples](https://bryntum.com/products/calendar/examples/?aw=smashing-calendar-options-2024), and you will also find helpful integration guides for Outlook and Google Calendar. Additionally, there’s an impressive collection of customized calendar examples that you can browse and choose from. 

A 45-day free trial is available, which includes over thirty examples for you to get started with. If you have any queries regarding the pricing and license, you can contact Bryntum at [https://bryntum.com/contact/](https://bryntum.com/contact/?aw=smashing-calendar-options-2024).

The Calendar/Scheduler, as it is, has a nice, comprehensible look and is easy to navigate. It is WCAG compliant and supports accessibility, something that screen reader users and keyboard navigators will appreciate. 

All the basic calendar features are impeccably executed, including showing different calendar views, like monthly, and creating recurring events and timelines. For easy customization, it comes with some built-in themes, or you can build your own with custom Sass variables.
